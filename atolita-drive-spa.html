    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        - Our Principles: Presented as a styled list for easy readability. Goal: Inform. Method: HTML list + Tailwind. Interaction: Static. Justification: Clear, concise presentation of foundational concepts for employees.
        - Shared Drive Structure: Interactive nested list/accordion. Clicking a drive reveals its Purpose, Your Access, and Sub-folders. Goal: Organize & Inform. Method: HTML + Tailwind + JS for interactivity. Interaction: Click to expand/collapse. Justification: Allows employees to explore the detailed structure relevant to their work without being overwhelmed, focusing on one drive at a time.
        - Canva Files: Text block integrated within relevant drive details or a dedicated note. Goal: Inform. Method: HTML + Tailwind. Interaction: Static.
        - Understanding Permissions: Descriptive text and styled cards/sections for roles. Goal: Inform. Method: HTML + Tailwind. Interaction: Static. Justification: Clear explanation of permission levels relevant to an employee's access.
        - Best Practices & Naming: Bulleted lists. Goal: Inform. Method: HTML + Tailwind. Interaction: Static.
        - Getting Started: Ordered list, framed as actionable steps for employees. Goal: Inform/Organize. Method: HTML + Tailwind. Interaction: Static.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. All visual structure via HTML/Tailwind. No Chart.js/Plotly.js as data is primarily textual/hierarchical.

            <p class="mb-6 text-stone-700">Welcome to Atolita's interactive guide for organizing our Google Drive! This guide is designed to help you easily understand and effectively use our new file management system. By following these guidelines, you'll contribute to a more organized, secure, and efficient workspace for everyone. Explore the sections to learn about our structure, how permissions work, and best practices for your daily tasks.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mb-3">Our Guiding Principles for Google Drive Organization</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-stone-700">
                <li><strong>Centralization:</strong> All team-owned content lives in Shared Drives. This ensures company data is safe and accessible, even if team members change.</li>
                <li><strong>Logical Hierarchy:</strong> Our folders are organized in a clear, intuitive way that mirrors our teams and projects, making it easy to find what you need.</li>
                <li><strong>Granular Permissions:</strong> You'll have access to exactly what you need for your role, and nothing more. This keeps our information secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> We use consistent naming and structures across all drives and folders to avoid confusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Dedicated External Sharing:</strong> We have specific, controlled areas for sharing with people outside Atolita, keeping our internal drives secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Review:</strong> We'll periodically review our system to ensure it remains effective and secure for everyone.</li>

                <p class="text-sm text-sky-600">While you create amazing designs in Canva, please remember to keep the *source* Canva files within Canva itself. Once a design is finalized and approved, please export it (e.g., as a PNG, JPG, or PDF) and save these *final assets* into the appropriate departmental Shared Drive (e.g., `Marketing/Marketing Assets` or `Communications/Press Kits`). This keeps our Google Drive focused on final, approved deliverables. You might also find a dedicated `Canva Exports` or `Design Assets` folder within `Atolita - Company Hub/01_Brand Guidelines & Assets` or `Atolita - Marketing/Marketing Assets`.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-stone-700">Understanding permissions is key to working effectively and securely in Google Drive. This section explains the different access levels you might encounter and how they apply to Shared Drives, folders, and individual files.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mb-3">1. Shared Drive Access Levels</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-stone-700">These roles determine what you can do within an entire Shared Drive:</p>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-6">

                    <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">Can manage members, content, and settings of the Shared Drive. (Typically for Department Heads or IT Admins).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-4 border border-stone-200 rounded-md bg-stone-50">
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-teal-700">Content Manager <span class="details-badge access-content-manager">Role</span></h4>
                    <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">Can add, edit, move, and delete content. (Often for Team Leads or Senior Staff managing content).</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">Can add and edit content. This is the common role for most team members actively working within a drive.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="p-4 border border-stone-200 rounded-md bg-stone-50">
                    <h4 class="font-semibold text-teal-700">Commenter <span class="details-badge access-commenter">Role</span></h4>
                    <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">Can only comment on files. Useful if you need to provide feedback without editing.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">Can only view files. This is for general access to resources or documents you only need to read.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-4 text-stone-700"><strong>Your Access:</strong> You will typically have "Content Manager" or "Contributor" access to your own departmental Shared Drive. For other relevant Shared Drives (like Company Hub or cross-functional projects), you'll likely have "Viewer" or "Commenter" access.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mb-3">2. Folder & File Level Permissions</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 text-stone-700">
                <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Permissions are usually inherited from the Shared Drive or parent folder.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Access:</strong> Sometimes, a specific folder (especially for confidential information) or individual file might have more restricted access than the rest of the drive.</li>
                <li><strong>External Sharing:</strong> When we share documents with external partners (clients, vendors), we always use the dedicated `Atolita - External Collaboration` Shared Drive. If you need to share something externally, please ensure it's placed there first, and only grant the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., "Viewer" for general documents, "Commenter" for review, "Editor" only if they need to actively contribute). **Never share entire departmental Shared Drives externally.**</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-700 mb-4">Best Practices & Getting Started</h2>
            <p class="mb-6 text-stone-700">To make our Google Drive system work efficiently for everyone, please follow these best practices. This section also outlines how you can get started with the new structure.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-600 mb-3">Best Practices for Files & Folders</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-stone-700 mb-6">
                <li>
                    <strong>File Naming:</strong> Use consistent file naming for easy identification and searching. A good practice is:
                    <code class="block bg-stone-100 p-2 rounded text-sm my-1">YYYYMMDD_ProjectName_DocumentTitle_Version.ext</code>
                    (e.g., <code class="text-xs">20250521_Q2Campaign_MarketingPlan_V2.docx</code>)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Folder Naming:</strong> Use clear, descriptive names for any new folders you create within the established structure. The main departmental drives are numbered (e.g., `01_Executive`) for easy sorting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>"My Drive" Usage:</strong> Your personal "My Drive" should be used only for:
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-4 mt-1 space-y-1">
                        <li>Truly personal, non-company-related files.</li>
                        <li>Temporary working files or drafts that you will eventually move to the appropriate Shared Drive once they are ready for team collaboration or finalization. **All company-owned work should eventually reside in a Shared Drive.**</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
